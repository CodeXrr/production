Today i've been rewriting code that is know lost, which is very
counter productive, but also a great learning experince from 
the aspect of backing up code (version control) as well as re-
creating the code in a better and easier form. 
I will be porting my code over to the helpers repos in github.
and finishing writing the code. 

4:00pm
After working through some of the basic command of git-hub for 
creating local repos, commiting, and pushing to the git-hub website,
I have determined that git-hub has saved me and changed my life. 
I know exactly where my projects are, I can track my status and
actually do some developing. I am still working out some kinks 
though because I am not quite profiecnt at commiting my work.
Like this second entry for the day, how do I push the changes that
I have made and will this cause a new branch? Only one way to find 
out.
