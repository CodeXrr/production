Today i've been rewriting code that is know lost, which is very
counter productive, but also a great learning experince from 
the aspect of backing up code (version control) as well as re-
creating the code in a better and easier form. 
I will be porting my code over to the helpers repos in github.
and finishing writing the code. 

4:00pm
After working through some of the basic command of git-hub for 
creating local repos, commiting, and pushing to the git-hub website,
I have determined that git-hub has saved me and changed my life. 
I know exactly where my projects are, I can track my status and
actually do some developing. I am still working out some kinks 
though because I am not quite profiecnt at commiting my work.
Like this second entry for the day, how do I push the changes that
I have made and will this cause a new branch? Only one way to find 
out.

9:36pm 
I was sucessfully able to commit my changes and update the repository.
Know I've moved on to cleaning up some code after finding my old strextract
function. Created the filex.h and filex.c helper funcitons for handling 
file handled, However these only deal with POSIX file and should'nt be
worried about to much. My next move is to integrate the string extraction
code into the rest of the helpers functions.
