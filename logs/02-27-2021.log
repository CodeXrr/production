TEXT: Today i've been rewriting code that is know lost, which is very
	counter productive, but also a great learning experince from 
	the aspect of backing up code (version control) as well as re-
	creating the code in a better and easier form. 
	I will be porting my code over to the helpers repos in github.
	and finishing writing the code.
