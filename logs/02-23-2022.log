Hello friend, its been a minute since I've actually did anything. A longer break
then expected, but comes with a new perpective and freshness. 
- A quick run-down of the past Sessions.
1. Ran into a reposotoriy (launchpad) signing issue (PGP) that has disallowed me to update my current linux mint 19 machine. 
2. Setting up a virtual hacking enviorment to run missions. VirtualBox has been a pain in the dick.... But i'm sure that alot of it has to do with the lack of updating on my behalf. Updating entire machine to linux 20 UMA. 
3. Physical access hacks: I have successfully reset my [password] on some forgotten accounts on my virtual ubuntu. 
4. In depth look at the linux sys. Learning how linux works at a lower level viaHowLinuxWorks book. 

So far so good, I've also have picked C back up naturally and set out and made a linked list. I'm ambitious for the future. 

HACKON -- [WELCOME BACK]
