Trying to break down the task of updating a git-hub repo. 
Earlier logs are explain the process vaguly goes over how git
is helpful but dosn't explalin how this process is actually carried
out and executed. 
Step 1: Make changes to a repo. And then we need to add to the git-repo
using the git add command. This adds the specified files to the index
and stages things for commiting later. (git add [FILEs])
Step 2: Now that the changes have been staged the next step is commiting
them, before we commit we can check the status by runnning (git status).
Once we confirm this is what we want we commit the changes by running 
(git commit -m ["message"])
Step 3: Finally, to reflect our changes we need to push this to our remote repo
via (git push [https://github.com/[username]/[repo.git]]), we will be prompted 
for our credintials and the changes will be made. 
Summary: add, commit, push
