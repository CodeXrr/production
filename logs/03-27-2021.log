Trying to break down the task of updating a git-hub repo. 
Earlier logs are explain the process vaguly goes over how git
is helpful but dosn't explalin how this process is actually carried
out and executed. 
Step 1: Make changes to a repo. And then we need to add to the git-repo
using the git add command. This adds the specified files to the index
and stages things for commiting later.
