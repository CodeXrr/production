Curenntly added to the filex files for getting file
positions and printing the current file pos. This 
is to aid in the help of dealing with files. Still
working on the design of my builds. Figuring out how 
to implement a build and need a more stratigic deign
build.

Everytime I sit down at a terminal I most act if I'm
on a mission and keep the objective in mind. A balance
of speed and eloquence though is required, moving to
fast may cause a heap of mistakes while moving to slow
will cause lack of inspiration. The correct speed is
that of a steady flow while giving a enough time to practice
new skills, like when using VIM. The goal is to create
good habits and break old ones.

Implementing the tatics which i wrote about in my last log.
I will create a new repo on git-hub so that I can port all 
the code from my book to. This code may seem trivial but I
will use it to learn the way by finding and exploiting all 
the security vulnerbilites that it may contain. This is for
learning purposes only. over and out.
